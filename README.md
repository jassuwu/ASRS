A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservation system.The owner has asked to program the new system in C. It is required to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the  airlines  only place (capacity: 15 seats). The program should never assign a seat which is already assigned. If there’s no seat available, then print the message " the flight is full ".After the flight is full and someone want to cancel the booking, it is displaying enter you’re the passport number  you want  to cancel it so after the  passenger cancel it, the system directly free that place id someone want to book that seat. Moreover, the system should bring a boarding pass indicating the persons' name, passport number and seat number as each seat is assigned, set the corresponding elements of array to 1 to indicate that seat is no longer available.

This program is designed by keeping in mind a Airport's seat reserving staff. It can receive, store, and display passenger data. 
Can download data into a .txt to extract passenger records. The seat structure and availability can be represented pictorially.
Includes a login feature to provide increased security.
